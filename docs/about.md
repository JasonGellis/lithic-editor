# About

## Project Background

This project originated from practical challenges encountered in preparing lithic illustrations for metric analysis using computer vision tools and archaeological software packages such as [PyLithics](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/Palaeoanalytics) ([Gellis et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.03738)). The initial development focused on automating ripple removal, but quickly expanded to include:

- Neural network-based image upscaling for low-resolution scans
- DPI-adaptive processing for varied input qualities
- Intelligent cortex preservation algorithms
- Interactive annotation tools for technological analysis
