## What is Lithic Editor?

Lithic Editor and Annotator is a specialized tool designed for archaeological research, specifically for processing technical drawings of lithic artifacts. It addresses two critical challenges in lithic illustration:

1. **Automated Ripple Line Removal**: The software uses advanced graph-based algorithms to identify and remove hatching/ripple lines while preserving the essential structural elements of the drawing.

2. **Technical Annotation System**: Provides intuitive tools for adding directional arrows to indicate striking direction and flake scar patterns - essential for archaeological analysis.

## Quick Start

=== "GUI Application"

    ```bash
    # Install the package
    pip install git+https://github.com/JasonGellis/lithic-editor.git
    
    # Launch the GUI
    lithic-editor --gui
    ```

=== "Python API"

    ```python
    from lithic_editor.processing import process_lithic_drawing
    
    # Process an image
    result = process_lithic_drawing(
        "lithic_drawing.png",
        save_debug=True
    )
    ```

=== "Command Line"

    ```bash
    # Process a single image
    lithic-editor process drawing.png --output results/
    ```

## Visual Example

<div class="comparison-container">
  <div class="before-after">
    <div class="image-box">
      <h3>Before Processing</h3>
      <p>Original drawing with ripple lines</p>
      <!-- Add your before image here -->
    </div>
    <div class="image-box">
      <h3>After Processing</h3>
      <p>Clean structural elements preserved</p>
      <!-- Add your after image here -->
    </div>
  </div>
