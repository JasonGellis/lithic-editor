## What is Lithic Editor?

Lithic Editor and Annotator is a comprehensive image processing tool designed for
preparing archaeological lithic illustrations. It combines advanced computer vision
techniques with domain-specific knowledge to edit and enhance technical drawings of
stone tool artifacts. The software addresses multiple challenges in lithic
illustration preparation and enhancement:

  - **Automated Ripple Line Removal**: Uses sophisticated graph-based algorithms to identify and remove hatching/ripple lines while
  preserving essential structural elements and cortex features of the drawing.

  - **Cortex Preservation**: Distinguishes between structural elements and
   cortex stippling, ensuring that important surface texture information is maintained
   during processing.

  - **Neural Network Upscaling**: Employs deep learning models to
  enhance low-resolution images, upscaling drawings below 300 DPI for
  improved detail and analysis quality.

  - **Technical Annotation System**: Provides intuitive tools for replacing scar ripples
   with directional arrows to indicate striking direction and flake scar patterns,
  enabling clear communication of technological information.

  - **Flexible Integration**: Offers GUI, command-line, and Python API interfaces for
  seamless integration into diverse archaeological analysis workflows.

## Visual Example

  <div class="before-after">
    <div class="image-box">
      <h3>Before Processing</h3>
      <p>Original drawing with ripple lines</p>
      <!-- Add your before image here -->
    </div>
    <div class="image-box">
      <h3>After Processing</h3>
      <p>Clean structural elements preserved</p>
